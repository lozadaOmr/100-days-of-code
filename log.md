# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started with the Settings App.

**Thoughts:** Decided to take a dive in Django, I've only manage to go through the first few topics in the tutorial. I guess though both are MVC, it is a bit different from Laravel but it is "batteries included" compared to Flask.

**Link to work:** [Settings App](https://github.com/lozadaOmr/ansi-admin/tree/feature/settings-app)

### Day 1: May 10, 2017

** Thoughts:** Missed today. I needed to be accountable to my commitment.
